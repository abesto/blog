A book catalog written in Python. Only available in Hungarian, but of course it could be translated. Fetches book information from antikvarium.hu by ISBN, where it found info for about 90-95% of the 500-odd books I added. Supports book categories, drag-and-drop for both the categories and the books, and file-type association in the Win32 installer.
