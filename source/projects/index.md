*   [python-ircd][2]: an experimental IRC server written in Python
*   [Mastermind][3]: a  game of Mastermind, played in the browser.
*   [Form Builder][4]: a simple table-based form builder for the browser. Only supports plain HTML inputs.
*   [Irina book catalog][5]: a desktop book catalog in Python, only available in Hungarian (if someone requests a translation I’ll probably do it)
*   [Java RPN Calculator][6]: what the title says. Uses higher order functions.
*   [Clojure RPN Calculator][7]: Same as above, only in Clojure. Very minimalistic, but trivial to extend.
