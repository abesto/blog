{% img /images/about/me.jpg Zoltán Nagy %}

I’m a web / backend / infrastrucure developer from Hungary, currently working at [Prezi][1]. I’ve been writing web applications since about 2008, while trying to check out at as many buzz-words as possible. I used Arch Linux at home for a while, and I’ve also picked up some knowledge about taking care of Ubuntu servers, load balancers, web servers and other such beasts. I tell others to do their HAproxy testing in a Vagrant box, and do my own in production.

I like melodic metal, hard rock, blues, cats and pyramids. Also imaginary dragons and boxes with lots of tiny feet. Seriously, go and read some Discworld novels.

## This blog

It's all about writing down some solutions I worked hard to get, that should be documented, but aren't. This means that usually I'm just getting my feet wet with the topic of a post. Lately I've been looking for some problems where I already know all the answers, so there's no risk of omitting something important. Turns out it's pretty hard to think of a technical problem that's not a problem for you - feel free to help out if you have any ideas.

Some posts use a "problem - solution - explanation" format, useful when you face the same situation. Others showcase a specific technology or concept related to web applications and infrastructure, or just to give you some food for thought. A few "look what I made" posts slip in as well from time to time. Please endulge me.

## What’s with the name?

I hit some letters at random when I needed a name for a character in a CRPG ages ago. I’ve tried to create other names the same way, but it just doesn’t work. Anyway, according to a Latin teacher from secondary school, it means "stay away". It’s supposed to be some kind of semi-ceremonial imperativus of absum.

## The past

I wrote my first post in 2008 on a Blogspot blog. Actually, you can still check it out [here.][2] Another one, where I’ve written the blog engine can be found [here.][3] The comments are 100% spam as far as I can see.
