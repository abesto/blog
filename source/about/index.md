## ~ me

{% img /images/about/me.jpg Zoltán Nagy %}

I’m a Hungarian web developer, currently in a backend/infrastructure developer position at Prezi. I’ve been writing web applications since about 2008, while trying to check out at as many buzz-words as possible. I use Arch Linux at home, and I’ve also become a semi-competent Linux server admin out of necessity. Yes, a little knowledge can really be worse than none at all, I’ve experienced it first hand.

I like music (melodic metal – rock – blues), and pyramids. Or rather imaginary dragons and boxes with lots of tiny feet. Seriously. I’ll just go and read a few Discworld novels again.

What, still here? Very well…

## ~ this blog

The keywords are (Arch)Linux desktop and server, PHP, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, sometimes Python, maybe some Apache or nginx here and there.

Some posts use a “problem – solution – explanation” format, useful when you face the same situation. Others showcase a specific technology or concept related to web applications, or just to give you some food for thought.

## What’s with the name?

My parents named me Zoltán, and it’s a great name, thankyouverymuch. Oh, not that one? Well. I hit some letters at random when I needed a name for a character in Sacred. I’ve tried to create other names the same way, but it just doesn’t work. Anyway, according to my Latin teacher in [whatever you have before university], it means “stay away”. It’s supposed to be some kind of old-fashioned imperativus of absum.

## History, plans

I wrote my first post in 2008 on a Blogspot blog. Actually, you can still check it out [here.][2] Another one, where I’ve written the blog engine can be found [here.][3] The comments are 100% spam as far as I can see.

I’ve been writing on and off since then – both posts and blog engines. Now that I gave up on the custom blog engine, I’ll hopefully have time for at least a post a week.
