## Things I'm proud of

Professionally, that is. Not in any particular order.

 * Being in the [AUTHORS file of Icinga 2](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/blob/657a328ba4939d70889789a695d051e6ad33654c/AUTHORS#L36). Just barely a few lines of code, but still.
 * The first implementation of the [Kotlin2Js Gradle plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/pull/524)
 * [pixi-kotlin](http://abesto.github.io/pixi-kotlin/): [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/) bindings for [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/)
 * [Changelog](https://github.com/prezi/changelog), an open-source change tracking tool for distributed systems. Also quite a few client libraries for it. ([blog post](https://medium.com/prezi-engineering/changelog-a-tool-designed-to-help-you-recover-faster-2aaca63dd276))
 * Having [some](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js/pull/125) [code](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js/pull/143) in [Bacon.js](https://baconjs.github.io/) for better integration with Node.js, and a link to my post [Bacon.js on the Server](http://abesto.net/bacon-js-on-the-server/) from the Bacon.js homepage.
 * Having been "headhunted" to work at [Prezi](https://prezi.com) at the age of 21
 * A [patch](https://github.com/skogsbaer/hscurses/pull/13) in [hscurses](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hscurses)
 * Becoming tech-lead of a small team (still at Prezi) at 23. Was kind of a surprise, didn't plan for it, but it's an exciting challenge.

## Who's this guy anyway?

I’m a backend / infrastrucure developer at [Prezi][1]. Started writing web applications around 2008, while trying to check out at as many buzz-words as possible. I make a hobby of learning any language and backend technology I come across.

I like listening to melodic metal, looking at cats and reading about pyramids. Also imaginary dragons and boxes with lots of tiny feet. Seriously, go and read some Discworld novels.

## This blog

It's all about writing down some solutions I worked hard to get, that should be documented, but aren't. This means that usually I'm just getting my feet wet with the topic of a post. Lately I've been looking for some problems where I already know all the answers, so there's no risk of omitting something important. Turns out it's pretty hard to think of a technical problem that's not a problem for you - feel free to help out if you have any ideas.

Some posts use a "problem - solution - explanation" format, useful when you face the same situation. Others showcase a specific technology or concept related to web applications and infrastructure, or just to give you some food for thought. A few "look what I made" posts slip in as well from time to time. Please endulge me.

## What’s with the name?

I hit some letters at random when I needed a name for a character in a CRPG ages ago. I’ve tried to create other names the same way, but it just doesn’t work. Anyway, according to a Latin teacher from secondary school, it means "stay away". It’s supposed to be some kind of semi-ceremonial imperativus of absum.

## Past incarnations of this here blog

I wrote my first post in 2008 on a Blogspot blog. Actually, you can still check it out [here.][2] Another one, where I’ve written the blog engine can be found [here.][3] The comments are 100% spam as far as I can see.
