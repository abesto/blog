Got some mild positive feedback on the last post like this, so let's do another one.

## News in AWS land

 * [EC2 Instance Console Screenshot](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-instance-console-screenshot/) is about letting you, assuming you're on HVM virtualization, take a screenshot. Click a button, get a screenshot. Awesome.
 * [Cross-Account Snapshot Sharing for Amazon Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-cross-account-snapshot-sharing-for-amazon-aurora/) is especially exciting, because cross-account snapshot sharing is a great way to implement off-site, separately ACL'd backups (don't forget to add cross-region as well).
 * [Amazon Aurora now supports cross region replication](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/06/amazon-aurora-now-supports-cross-region-replication/). And that's just great for building high-availability database clusters on Aurora.
 * [EC2 Run Command](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/ec2-run-command-update-manage-share-commands-and-more/) is an interesting way of managing your servers without ever touching Chef or Ansible or any of those thingies. I'm not sure I'd ever use it, but there's a certain charm to having a button that installs all Windows updates on your node.
 * [Export Redis Snapshots to Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-elasticache-update-export-redis-snapshots-to-amazon-s3/) is another one where you can take a backup off-site, this time for Redis-backed ElastiCache.

## Soft, squishy, managery

You know that guy, Seth Godin? His blog is like a feed of daily motivational quotes, except they're management / startup related thoughts that seem to make sense. Here's a few I liked recently:
