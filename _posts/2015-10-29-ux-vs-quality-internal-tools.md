title: UX vs quality in internal tools
---

When working on internal tools, I often find ourselves talking about quality as
a value in itself (an
[intrinsic value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(ethics)), if
you will); both when considering plans, and when communicating with our users
(developers, in this case).

Last week I came across a (taxi|cab) sporting a tagline along the
lines of "committed to quality". What I realized is that I have no idea what it
means for a cab or cab company to be of high quality. What I care about is
getting from A to B in reasonable time, for a reasonable price, without anything
bad happening (like, say, an accident, or the driver being rude, which is
arguably even worse than an accident).

I don't care one bit about the size of the engine, tire pressure, or the color
 of the toe-nails of the driver. All I care about is having a pleasant
 experience while getting the results I expect.

So here's a thought: the same applies to developer tools, even internal
developer tools. Quality, as in code quality, is only interesting in that it
allows us to implement new features and fix bugs faster. What matters in the end
is the experience developers have while using our tool - that they get the
result they want, that they have a good experience on the way (the tool is
"delightful"), and that nothing bad happens.

This of course leads to a more generic and stronger point: developer tools are
products. Especially internal tools: they need to create very real value,
otherwise it doesn't make sense to work on them as opposed to working directly
on the product of the company. Since companies usually have very limited
resources for working on internal tools, the trade-off between spending time on
refactoring code and spending time on fixing bad UX is extremely pronounced.

In short: internal tools are a product with scarce resources; plan accordingly.
