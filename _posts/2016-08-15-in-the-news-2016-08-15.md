[Backdooring an AWS account](https://danielgrzelak.com/backdooring-an-aws-account-da007d36f8f9)  
An illuminating read on what you'd want to do after compromising an AWS account. Inversely, what you'd want to prevent / monitor when you have an AWS account. It focuses on making sure you can keep your access to the account, even after discovery.

[StatusPage.io Joining The Atlassian Family](http://blog.statuspage.io/joining-the-atlassian-family)

[AWS acquires collaborative coding company Cloud9 IDE](http://venturebeat.com/2016/07/14/aws-acquires-collaborative-coding-company-cloud9-ide/)  
I've first tried Cloud9 over four years ago. That fact that they're still around is impressive. The fact that they're acquired by AWS is pointing in the direction of AWS becoming a one-stop platform for all steps of a backend / web development workflow.

[Using Docker tags to mess with peopleâ€™s minds](https://medium.com/microscaling-systems/using-docker-tags-to-mess-with-peoples-minds-367bb2c93bd0)  
 Contrary to the title, this post is a concise collection of best practices and useful tricks using Docker tags.

[Microsoft REST API Guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines.md)  
A gigantic page of rules and practices open-sourced by Microsoft. I don't know how strictly they follow it (and for what APIs), but it looks like a solid starting point, or just an idea of repositories, for designing your own guidelines.

[Stack Exchange Postmortem](http://stackstatus.net/post/147710624694/outage-postmortem-july-20-2016)  
An impressive post-mortem by Stack Exchange - you know, the entity behind StackOverflow.

[crontab.guru - the cron schedule expression editor](http://crontab.guru/)  
I always forget the syntax of `crontab` files. This helps.

[`httpolice`: Lint for HTTP](https://github.com/vfaronov/httpolice)  
A linter for HTTP requests and responses. How does your site rate?

["My Philosophy on Alerting" - Rob Ewaschuk](https://docs.google.com/document/d/199PqyG3UsyXlwieHaqbGiWVa8eMWi8zzAn0YfcApr8Q)  
Clear, short formulation of monitoring and alerting best practices collected and refined over the past 5-10 years. Perfectly aligned with practices shared at Monitorama (THE monitoring conference).

[Nut](http://matthieudelaro.github.io/nut/)  
The development environment, containerized. Haven't tried it out yet, but I like the promise.

[`noms`: The versioned, forkable, syncable database](https://github.com/attic-labs/noms)  
What the title says. It's a database built on concepts generally used in VCSs, and specifically in `git`.

[AWS Application Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-application-load-balancer/)  
A new ELB-like feature, with URL-based routing capabilities.
