We just had a national holiday, which meant a longish weekend with my parents. We played some board games, and as a result I hacked up a Mastermind game in CoffeeScript that runs entirely in the browser. It took about six-eight hours, and it was actually quite fun.

The model was done in an hour or so, but without any tests. I decided to do only manual testing, which added some time at the end, but whatever. The UI took a bit longer, and it doesn’t look as good as it could. It’s also not optimal, but it’s good enough. It’d be great if someone could spend some time polishing it… *nudge-nudge, wink-wink*

Anyway, here’s the game: http://mastermind.abesto.net
