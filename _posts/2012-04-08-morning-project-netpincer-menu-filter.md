[NetPincér][1] is an online food ordering service in Hungary. The website has quite a few problems, but one of the most annoying ones is that there’s no way to filter the menu of a restaurant based on what’s in the food. Even though most of the restaurants list some ingredients as the description of the course.

Solution: a user script that adds whitelist and blacklist filtering. It looks like this:

It works in both Chrome as a user script and as a Gresemonkey script in Firefox. You can get it from userscripts.org:
