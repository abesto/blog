How've you been? Keeping on keeping on? Crazy year huh?

So the reason I haven't been writing much is... actually, I *have* been writing a bunch, just not _here_. I spent a whole bunch of time writing a book.

Significant chunks of software engineering consist of making a computer understand an idea you've had. This isn't always writing code. Sometimes it's pressing alt-tab fifteen times to find the window you want. Other times it's browsing `man find` for the hundredth time. Yet other times the problem is not even the translation into computer-speak - it's formulating intentions clearly enough to qualify for translation at all. This book walks through the major components of a well-built development environment, aiming to also provide general techniques applicable to any technology.

Topics covered: editors, operating systems, window managers, terminal emulators and shells, configuration management. Focuses on Linux, and macOS.
